📊 Predicting Customer Satisfaction with Decision Tree and Naive Bayes: Self-Created Dataset (Data Mining)
Welcome to the repository for our Data Mining class project! This project involves the implementation and analysis of Decision Tree and Gaussian Naive Bayes algorithms to predict customer satisfaction. Below, you'll find an overview of the project, key insights, and instructions to get started.

📘 Project Overview
This project delves into the application of machine learning techniques, specifically:

Decision Tree
Gaussian Naive Bayes
The study rigorously evaluates the performance of these models using training and test datasets, which were self-created for this Data Mining class. The datasets include both noise and redundant features to examine their impact on model performance.

📊 Datasets
Two distinct types of datasets were created:

Dataset with Noise and Redundant Features: Incorporates noise factors such as weather and cashier mood, and redundant features like payment method and cashier gender.
Dataset without Noise but with Redundant Features: Focuses on the impact of redundant features without the influence of noise.
🔍 Key Insights
Decision Tree Algorithm: Evaluated under three scenarios - with and without noise and redundant features. The model showed high precision and stability, even when dealing with noisy and imbalanced data.

Gaussian Naive Bayes Algorithm: Also evaluated under similar scenarios. The model struggled with precision and showed a high number of false negatives, particularly in the presence of redundant features. It performed better with noisy data but still exhibited biases.

📈 Performance Metrics
Accuracy: Measures the overall correctness of the model.
Recall: Evaluates the model's ability to capture positive instances.
F1-Score: Provides a balance between precision and recall.
